# Nub-ui design system

Hakkei design system for web components.  This project is extended from [Outline Storybook](https://github.com/phase2/outline).

> A Design System is the single source of truth which groups all the elements that will allow the teams to design, realize and develop a product.
Design systems make it possible to create and reproduce designs at a faster pace.
One of the primary benefits is that you can use premade UI components and elements, which saves time from having to reinvent the wheel-a risk with inconsistent design.

## What are web components?
Web components are reusable custom elements with their functionality encapsulated away from the rest of your code. They are built on Web Component standards, will work across modern browsers, and can be used with any JavaScript library or framework that works with HTML.

### Supported browsers
For best performance, we recommend the last two (2) versions of these web browsers:

* Chrome
* Firefox
* Microsoft Edge
* Safari

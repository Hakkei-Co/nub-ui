# Helpful Commands

## Resetting local environment

The following commands help clean a local environment.

- Cleanup generated assets: `yarn clean`
- Cleanup node packages: `yarn reset`
- Full cleanup & restart: `yarn reboot`

## Coding standards

Code is not automatically formatted upon commit, but automated tests will fail if you don't format code according to the tooling (Prettier).

You can run `yarn fmt` or configure your IDE to run these commands for you.

_Caution: Prettier will sometimes format code in a weird way, so you may want to review its changes._

### Linting

You can run `yarn lint` to view any coding style warnings.
